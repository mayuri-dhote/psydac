Contents of typical HDF5 output file containing the field coefficients:

fields.h5/
    snapshot_0/                   -> group    : a new one is created when we write to file
        .t                        -> attribute: time instant (float)
        .ts                       -> attribute: time step number (int)
        [patch]/                  -> group    : same name as patch in spaces.yml
            [scalar_field]        -> dataset  : field coefficients, dataset has name of field
                .space     : str  -> attribute: same name as scalar or vector space in spaces.yml
                .component : int  -> attribute: index of vector component (NOTE: is this really neeeded?)
